# Astreia

Astreia is a machine learning model verification system for public and private
use.

Its primary purpose is to serve *Model Users* who need a machine learning (ML)
*Model* to generate predictions to fulfill use cases such as forecasting,
decision support, or product recommendation. The fundamental assumption made my
Astreia is that *Model Users* do not have the technical capacity to build these
systems, so they need to contract *Model Providers*, that is, third party
software services.

Astreia aims to solve three fundamental problems in real-world applications of
machine learning:

1. *Model Users* are often unable to assess the quality or health of *Models*
   offered by *Model Providers*.
2. *Models* degrade in quality over time due to covariate shift.
3. *Model Providers* are insufficiently incentivized to maintain the quality
   of their *Models*.
